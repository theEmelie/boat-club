## CLASS DIAGRAM

*All classes and methods are added due to the instructions "The class diagram should correspond exactly to the final implementation."*
One might say that the view includes a lot of methods and should be split up into several classes. But, most of the methods are very small, only one line of code, and because they require the userInput from the Scanner, it is not as easy to just add them to a seperate class. It is possible to add them into a use case method instead, but this is how I decided to do it for this time, I'd like to think that the view class sill got pretty high cohesion.
